# Kronos.AI

In this world of rapid technological change and automation, a student may feel the need for visualizations and a problem-solving guide for his or her in his academics, especially for a core centric concept like physics. So, wouldn’t it be easy to scroll many videos or sites over an automation which can help people with the confusing variables and basic questions?

In line with this vision, we have developed Kronos.AI, a Physics Chatbot which can prove to be instrumental in teaching elementary physics. Physics is considered as a visually challenging and memory application driven field. So, we have attempted to create a data-oriented bot which can generate response automatically with respect to specific keywords, along with offering comments on doubts, and offering specially designed modules to foster a depth rich conceptual pedagogy.

Kronos, is based on 'Scythe Kronos', the roman equivalent of Saturn, majorly attributed as the allegory of time. The key idea vests in building a time saving alternative with a interactive interface with dynamic and versatile resource pool to achieve more in less time, to help achieve the unthinkable - 'Croire en son étoile.'
